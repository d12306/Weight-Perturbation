# Weight-Perturbation
The code snippets for testing the model performance when the weights are undergoing slight perturbations.  

The slight weight perturbation is proved to affect the generalization performance against testing dataset. Also, recently, there is a trend that considers the model robustness against weight perturbations, but not well studied compared to the adversarial attacks.
